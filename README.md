# RockbusterStealthAnalysis

Rockbuster Stealth is a fictional movie rental company that was launching an online store. This project, part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program, was designed to introduce us to both SQL (pgAdmin4) and Tableau. We began with an overview of the tools, understanding and creating a data dictionary, writing moderately complex queries, and creating visualizations that will prepare us for the real world.

Objective
The objective of this project with Rockbuster Stealth was to understand their customer base to enter the online world of rentals without missing a beat.
